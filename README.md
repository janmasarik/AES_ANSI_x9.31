# ANSI X9.31 PRNG based on AES 128-bit

Implementation based on [NIST Specification](https://web.archive.org/web/20140813123026/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/rng/931rngext.pdf).

Uses insecure ECB mode and even though it passes tests from NIST STS, it obviously shouldn't be used for any serious purposes.
